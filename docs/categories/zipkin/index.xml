      <description>Tracing Motivation The more distributed a system the harder it is to debug errors, find latency, and to understand the potentially cascading impact of a bug. External monitoring only tells you the overall response time and number of invocations but doesnâ€™t give us a way to understand internal invocations. Structured log entries can be correllated, eventually, to paint a picture of the movement of a request through a system, but structured logs are not easy to query.</description>
