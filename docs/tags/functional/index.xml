      <title>Setup and customize Authentication against a WebFlux Application</title>

      <description>Configuring Authentication against a WebFlux app This demonstration examines Spring Security WebFlux&amp;rsquo;s Authentication mechanisms. We will look at Authentication request escalation, as well as user-domain customizations.
Authentication flow-control How do we determine when a request must provide an authentication context? Spring does this with help from an AuthenticationEntryPoint that identifies un-authenticated requests and returns with a response to the user to perform some authentication action.
Configure ServerHttpSecurity to use HTTP-BASIC by calling it&amp;rsquo;s httpBasic() method.</description>

      <title>Reactive Websocket Client with Spring</title>

      <description>This Demo This demo client will connect and receive events from any URL that emits an open websocket stream. We have an existing server to stand up that can supply the socket events. A reactive client means that we can respond to backpressure, and weild the Observer pattern to our client connections.
The Client (SANS web) We can use our favorite Spring Application Initializr start dot spring dot io to generate the application.</description>

      <title>Intro to RIFF Is For Functions</title>

      <description>Motivation of Functions Functions as a Service are a new paradigm for application composition and deployment. Functions are a smaller deployable unit than microservices and especially traditional monoliths. Project Riff is a new Pivotal project that runs functions in a cloud environment like Pivotal Container Services (Kubernetes). Lets get started by setting up a new Riff environment and then creating some functions.
Preparing the environment minikube is the tool that weâ€™ll use to run Kubernetes locally.</description>
