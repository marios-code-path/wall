      <description>Why Finagle Finagle is a Service building framework that lets developers write non-blocking services with ease. In this example, we will go through the steps to deploy a basic Finagle Service that takes advantage of the Twitter services eco-system in TwitterServer, Guice and of coure Scala.
JVM Functions in Scala Finagle is written in Scala, and works best in applications - scala or java - that want to take the functional services approach.</description>

      <title>Setup and Customize a Login Page With Reactive Spring Security.</title>

      <description>Customized WebFlux Form Authentication This demonstration examines Spring Security WebFlux&amp;rsquo;s Authentication mechanisms. We will look at authentication with HTML forms using Mustache, User Authentication, and customized form-based login / logout configurations.
The ServerHttpSecurity Configuration SecurityWebFilterChain is the governing chain of [WebFilter]&amp;rsquo;s that allows us to lock down reactive WebFlux applications. With @EnableWebFluxSecurity turned on, we can build this object by issuing commands to the ServerHttpSecurity DSL object.
SecurityConfiguration.java:
@EnableWebFluxSecurity @Slf4j @Configuration public class SecurityConfiguration { @Bean public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) { return http .</description>

      <description>Configuring Authentication against a WebFlux app This demonstration examines Spring Security WebFlux&amp;rsquo;s Authentication mechanisms. We will look at Authentication request escalation, as well as user-domain customizations.
Authentication flow-control How do we determine when a request must provide an authentication context? Spring does this with help from an AuthenticationEntryPoint that identifies un-authenticated requests and returns with a response to the user to perform some authentication action.
Configure ServerHttpSecurity to use HTTP-BASIC by calling it&amp;rsquo;s httpBasic() method.</description>

      <title>Reactive Websocket Client with Spring</title>
      <link>https://www.sudoinit5.com/post/spring-reactive-ws-client/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sudoinit5.com/post/spring-reactive-ws-client/</guid>
      <description>This Demo This demo client will connect and receive events from any URL that emits an open websocket stream. We have an existing server to stand up that can supply the socket events. A reactive client means that we can respond to backpressure, and weild the Observer pattern to our client connections.
The Client (SANS web) We can use our favorite Spring Application Initializr start dot spring dot io to generate the application.</description>

      <description>Spring Kafka Writer and Readers What is Kafka Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. You&amp;rsquo;ll find more information about Kafka at it&amp;rsquo;s Homepage.
Intro to Spring For Apache Kafka The Spring for Apache Kafka (spring-kafka) project applies core Spring concepts to the development of Kafka-based messaging solutions. It provides a &amp;ldquo;template&amp;rdquo; as a high-level abstraction for sending messages.</description>

      <title>Intro to RIFF Is For Functions</title>
      <link>https://www.sudoinit5.com/post/riff-intro/</link>

      <description>Motivation of Functions Functions as a Service are a new paradigm for application composition and deployment. Functions are a smaller deployable unit than microservices and especially traditional monoliths. Project Riff is a new Pivotal project that runs functions in a cloud environment like Pivotal Container Services (Kubernetes). Lets get started by setting up a new Riff environment and then creating some functions.
Preparing the environment minikube is the tool that weâ€™ll use to run Kubernetes locally.</description>
